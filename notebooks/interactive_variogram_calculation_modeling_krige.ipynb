    "### Interactive Variogram Calculation, Modeling and Kriging\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an interactive workflow for calculating directional experimental variograms in 2D, modeling the variograms and applying the variogram models to calculate spatial estimation maps with kriging. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Wherever you see -999 values you must update with your own choices.\n",
    "* When you make changes you must rerun the subsuquent code update the results.\n",
    "* When you save your workflow and reload the interactive GUIs are reset so record you parameters before exiting, e.g., screen captures.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this workflow you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Spatial Data**, select from available datasets on Dr. Pyrcz's GitHub GeoDataSets repository or load your own dataset. Make sure that the following variables are consistent with the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - feature and feature_units - the name of the feature in the dataframe and the units of the feature\n",
    "    - vmin and vmax - the minimum and maximum values of the feature\n",
    "    - xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax - the area of interest for plotting and building a kriged map\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inspect the Posted Data**, visualize the data location map over the area of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "    - make sure the area of interest covers the data and does not extend too far from data (i.e. extreme spatial extrapolation)\n",
    "    - visually check for obvious sample bias with clustered samples over highs or lows\n",
    "    - visually check for minimum lag spacing and possible major direction of continuity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Declustering**,  apply cell beased declustering to the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - calculate the declustered mean to apply as the stationary mean for simple kriging. Recall away from data the mean gets a weight of $1-\\sum_{\\alpha = 1}^{n} \\lambda_{\\alpha}$\n",
    "    - calculate the declustered variance as the variogram sill and the maximum kriging estimation variance outside the range of all of the data (note ordinary kriging estimation variance can exceed the sill)\n",
    "    - select reasonable parameters for declustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "find_minimizing_cell_size = -999\n",
    "number_offsets = -999\n",
    "number_cell_sizes = -999\n",
    "min_cell_size = -999\n",
    "max_cell_size = -999\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Directional Experimental Variograms**, set the directional variogram calculation search template parameters to find the major and minor directions of continuity and produce the more interpretable experimental variograms possible\n",
    "\n",
    "    - use the interactive GUI to calculate the directional variograms\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model the Directional Variograms**, use up to 2 nest variogram structures plus nugget if present to model the directional variogram \n",
    "\n",
    "    - rerun the code to update with a new experimental variogram and declustered variance / sill\n",
    "    - use the interactive GUI to fit the directional variogram model\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Spatial Predictions with Kriging**, use the declustering results and variogram model with the data to calculate spatial estimation maps with kriging\n",
    "\n",
    "    - rerun the code to update with a new variogram model and declustered stationary mean and variance / sill\n",
    "    - set the kriging parameters, note vdmean is the declustered mean, you can reduce ndmax to speed up the run but may add limited search artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "skmean = vdmean                            # simple kriging mean (used if simple kriging is selected below)\n",
    "ktype = 0                                  # kriging type, 0 - simple, 1 - ordinary\n",
    "radius = -999                              # search radius for neighbouring data\n",
    "ndmin = -999; ndmax = -999                 # minimum and maximum data for an estimate\n",
    "tmin =  -1.0e21; tmax = 1.0e21             # data trimming limits, set very small and large to not trim the data\n",
    "```\n",
    "7. **Spatial Prediction with Kriging - One Location with Uncertainty Model**, use the previous kriging estimate and kriging estimation variance maps to calculate the uncertainty model at a single location\n",
    "\n",
    "    - select the location with this code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 500                                     # location to estimate\n",
    "y = 500\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's some more basic details on each topic for convenience. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Continuity \n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial Continuity** is the correlation between values over distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No spatial continuity – no correlation between values over distance, random values at each location in space regardless of separation distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Homogenous phenomenon have perfect spatial continuity, since all values as the same (or very similar) they are correlated. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need a statistic to quantify spatial continuity! A convenient method is the Semivariogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Semivariogram\n",
    "\n",
    "Function of difference over distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The expected (average) squared difference between values separated by a lag distance vector (distance and direction), $h$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\gamma(\\bf{h}) = \\frac{1}{2 N(\\bf{h})} \\sum^{N(\\bf{h})}_{\\alpha=1} (z(\\bf{u}_\\alpha) - z(\\bf{u}_\\alpha + \\bf{h}))^2  \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z(\\bf{u}_\\alpha)$ and $z(\\bf{u}_\\alpha + \\bf{h})$ are the spatial sample values at tail and head locations of the lag vector respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculated over a suite of lag distances to obtain a continuous function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the $\\frac{1}{2}$ term converts a variogram into a semivariogram, but in practice the term variogram is used instead of semivariogram.\n",
    "* We prefer the semivariogram because it relates directly to the covariance function, $C_x(\\bf{h})$ and univariate variance, $\\sigma^2_x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "C_x(\\bf{h}) = \\sigma^2_x - \\gamma(\\bf{h})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the correlogram is related to the covariance function as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\rho_x(\\bf{h}) = \\frac{C_x(\\bf{h})}{\\sigma^2_x}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlogram provides of function of the $\\bf{h}-\\bf{h}$ scatter plot correlation vs. lag offset $\\bf{h}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "-1.0 \\le \\rho_x(\\bf{h}) \\le 1.0\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variogram Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are common observations for variograms that should assist with their practical use.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Observation \\#1 - As distance increases, variability increase (in general).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is common since in general, over greater distance offsets, there is often more difference between the head and tail samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, such as with spatial cyclicity of the hole effect variogram model the variogram may have negative slope over somelag distance intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative slopes at lag distances greater than half the data extent are often caused by too few pairs for a reliable variogram calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Observation \\#2 - Calculated with over all possible pairs separated by lag vector, $\\bf{𝐡}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We scan through the entire data set, searching for all possible pair combinations with all other data.  We then calculate the variogram as one half the expectation of squared difference between all pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "More pairs results in a more reliable measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Observation \\#3 - Need to plot the sill to know the degree of correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sill** is the variance, $\\sigma^2_x$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given stationarity of the variance, $\\sigma^2_x$, and variogram $\\gamma(\\bf{h})$:\n",
    "\n",
    "we can define the covariance function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "C_x(\\bf{h}) = \\sigma^2_x - \\gamma(\\bf{h})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance measure is a measure of similarity over distance (the mirror image of the variogram as shown by the equation above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a standardized distribution $\\sigma^2_x = 1.0$, the covariance, $C_x(\\bf{h})$, is equal to the correlogram, $\\rho_x(\\bf{h})$: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\rho_x(\\bf{h}) = \\sigma^2_x - \\gamma(\\bf{h})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Observation \\#4 - The lag distance at which the variogram reaches the sill is know as the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the range, knowing the data value at the tail location provides no information about a value at the head location of the lag distance vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Observation \\#5 - The nugget effect, a discontinuity at the origin\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes there is a discontinuity in the variogram at distances less than the minimum data spacing.  This is known as **nugget effect**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio of nugget / sill, is known as relative nugget effect (%). Modeled as a discontinuity with no correlation structure that at lags, $h \\gt \\epsilon$, an infinitesimal lag distance, and perfect correlation at $\\bf{h} = 0$.\n",
    "Caution when including nuggect effect in the variogram model as measurement error, mixing populations cause apparent nugget effect\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise demonstrates the semivariogram calculation with GeostatsPy. The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. generate a 2D model with sequential Gaussian simulation\n",
    "2. sample from the simulation\n",
    "3. calculate and visualize experimental semivariograms\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variogram Calculation Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The variogram calculation parameters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **azimuth** is the azimuth of the lag vector\n",
    "\n",
    "* **azimuth tolerance** is the maximum allowable departure from the azimuth (isotropic variograms are calculated with an azimuth tolerance of to 90.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **unit lag distance** the size of the bins in lag distance, usually set to the minimum data spacing\n",
    "\n",
    "* **lag distance tolerance** - the allowable tolerance in lage distance, commonly set to 50% of unit lag distanceonal smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "* **number of lags** - set based on the spatial extent of the dataset, we can typically calculate reliable variograms up to 1/2 the extent of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* **bandwidth** is the maximum offset allowable from the lag vector \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variogram Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial continuity can be modeled with nested, positive definate variogram structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Gamma_x(\\bf{h}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{nst} \\gamma_i(\\bf{h})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Gamma_x(\\bf{h})$ is the nested variogram model resulting from the summation of $nst$ nested variograms  $\\gamma_i(\\bf{h})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The types of structure commonly applied include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* spherical\n",
    "\n",
    "* exponential\n",
    "\n",
    "* gaussian\n",
    "\n",
    "* nugget\n",
    "\n",
    "Other less common models include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* hole effect\n",
    "\n",
    "* dampenned hole effect\n",
    "\n",
    "* power law\n",
    "\n",
    "these will not be covered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each one of these variogram structures, $\\gamma_i(\\bf{h})$, is based on a geometric anisotropy model parameterized by the orientation and range in the major and minor directions.  In 2D this is simply an azimuth and ranges, $azi$, $a_{maj}$ and $a_{min}$. Note, the range in the minor direction (orthogonal to the major direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometric anisotropy model assumes that the range in all off-diagonal directions is based on an ellipse with the major and minor axes alligned with and set to the major and minor for the variogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\bf{h}_i = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{r_{maj}}{a_{maj_i}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{r_{maj}}{a_{maj_i}}\\right)^2}  \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if we know the major direction, range in major and minor directions, we may completely describe each nested componnent of the complete spatial continuity of the variable of interest, $i = 1,\\dots,nst$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some comments on modeling nested variograms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we can capture nugget, short and long range continuity structures\n",
    "\n",
    "* we rely on the geometric anisotropy model, so all structures must inform the same level of contribution (porportion of the sill) in all directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the geometric anisotropy model is based on azimuth of the major direction of continuity, range in the major direction and range in the minor direction (orthogonal to the major direction).  The range is interpolated between the major and minor azimuths with a ellipse model\n",
    "\n",
    "* we can vary the type of variogram, direction or azimuth of the major direction, and major and minor ranges by structure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case of making an estimate at some unsampled location, $𝑧(\\bf{u}_0)$, where $z$ is the property of interest (e.g. porosity etc.) and $𝐮_0$ is a location vector describing the unsampled location.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you do this given data, $𝑧(\\bf{𝐮}_1)$, $𝑧(\\bf{𝐮}_2)$, and $𝑧(\\bf{𝐮}_3)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be natural to use a set of linear weights to formulate the estimator given the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "z^{*}(\\bf{u}) = \\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} z(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We could add an unbiasedness constraint to impose the sum of the weights equal to one.  What we will do is assign the remainder of the weight (one minus the sum of weights) to the global average; therefore, if we have no informative data we will estimate with the global average of the property of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "z^{*}(\\bf{u}) = \\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} z(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha}) + \\left(1-\\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} \\right) \\overline{z}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make a stationarity assumption, so let's assume that we are working with residuals, $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y^{*}(\\bf{u}) = z^{*}(\\bf{u}) - \\overline{z}(\\bf{u})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we substitute this form into our estimator the estimator simplifies, since the mean of the residual is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y^{*}(\\bf{u}) = \\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} y(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "while satisfying the unbaisedness constraint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kriging\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the next question is what weights should we use?  \n",
    "\n",
    "We could use equal weighting, $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n}$, and the estimator would be the average of the local data applied for the spatial estimate. This would not be very informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could assign weights considering the spatial context of the data and the estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **spatial continuity** as quantified by the variogram (and covariance function)\n",
    "* **redundancy** the degree of spatial continuity between all of the available data with themselves \n",
    "* **closeness** the degree of spatial continuity between the avaiable data and the estimation location\n",
    "\n",
    "The kriging approach accomplishes this, calculating the best linear unbiased weights for the local data to estimate at the unknown location.  The derivation of the kriging system and the resulting linear set of equations is available in the lecture notes.  Furthermore kriging provides a measure of the accuracy of the estimate!  This is the kriging estimation variance (sometimes just called the kriging variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma^{2}_{E}(\\bf{u}) = C(0) - \\sum^{n}_{\\alpha = 1} \\lambda_{\\alpha} C(\\bf{u}_0 - \\bf{u}_{\\alpha})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "What is 'best' about this estimate? Kriging estimates are best in that they minimize the above estimation variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties of Kriging\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some important properties of kriging:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exact interpolator** - kriging estimates with the data values at the data locations\n",
    "* **Kriging variance** can be calculated before getting the sample information, as the kriging estimation variance is not dependent on the values of the data nor the kriging estimate, i.e. the kriging estimator is homoscedastic. \n",
    "* **Spatial context** - kriging takes into account, furthermore to the statements on spatial continuity, closeness and redundancy we can state that kriging accounts for the configuration of the data and structural continuity of the variable being estimated.\n",
    "* **Scale** - kriging may be generalized to account for the support volume of the data and estimate. We will cover this later.\n",
    "* **Multivariate** - kriging may be generalized to account for multiple secondary data in the spatial estimate with the cokriging system. We will cover this later.\n",
    "* **Smoothing effect** of kriging can be forecast. We will use this to build stochastic simulations later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workflow we will explore methods to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. decluster the data to calculate a representative mean\n",
    "2. interactively detect directionality from a spatial dataset\n",
    "3. interactively calculate the directional variograms in the major and minor directions \n",
    "4. interactively build a consistent 2D model fit to the major and minor directions\n",
    "5. apply the variogram model for building an spatial estimated map with simple kriging with the representative mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, since we are using the variogram for estimation, we will not Gaussian transform the feature first.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the sill of the variogram will be equal to the variance of the data and not necesssarily 1.0 as with the standard normal distribution.\n",
