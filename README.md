Instructor: Michael Pyrcz, The University of Texas at Austin

#### Course Summary

Building from fundamental probability and statistics, we cover entire spatial data analytics and geostatistics best practice workflows from data preparation through to decision making. We will accomplish this with,

* Interactive lectures / discussion to cover the basic concepts

* Demonstrations of methods and workflows in Python 

* Hands-on experiential learning with well-documented workflows for accessibility


#### Course Objectives

Spatial data analytics and geostatistics for building spatial prediction and uncertainty models.

You will learn:

* spatial data debiasing

* quantification and modeling of spatial continuity / correlation

* spatial estimation with uncertainty

* spatial simulation for subsurface resource forecasting

* checking spatial models

* decision making with spatial uncertainty models
